Data Type,Source/Destination,Example Fields / Description,Sensitive?,Privacy Needed?,Notes / Recommendations
User Credentials,User → Backend (Auth API),username; password; email,Yes,Yes,Store hashed; never log or expose; use HTTPS/JWT.
User Profile,User → Backend (DB),name; email; registration info,Yes,Yes,Protect with access control.
Device Info,Device/Simulator → Backend,device_id; device_name; location,Yes*,Sometimes,Device ID/location can be sensitive if linked to user; restrict access.
Sensor Data,Device/Simulator → Backend/DB,sensor_type; value; unit; timestamp; device_id,Maybe,Sometimes,Add privacy noise (done); AI analysis via local Ollama (no cloud); review retention policy.
System Metrics,RPi Simulator → Backend/DB,cpu_temp; mem_usage; disk_usage,No,No,Not user-specific; no special privacy needed.
Alerts,Backend → Dashboard/Email,alert_type; description; device_id; timestamp; severity,Maybe,Sometimes,AI descriptions generated by local Ollama llama3.2:1b; redact user/device info if needed.
Anomaly Scores,Backend (Ollama AI) → DB/Dashboard,is_anomaly; anomaly_score; explanation; severity,No,No,Generated by local Ollama llama3.2:1b model; no external API used.
Control Commands,Dashboard → Device (MQTT),command_type; parameters; device_id,Maybe,Sometimes,If command reveals user intent, consider privacy; log minimally.
Logs,Backend → DB/Files,event; user_id; device_id; timestamp,Yes*,Sometimes,Mask user/device IDs in logs if possible; restrict log access.
Email Addresses,User → Backend (Alerts),email (for notifications),Yes,Yes,Never expose; encrypt in DB if possible; use only for alerts.
API Tokens/JWT,Backend → User/Client,JWT token,Yes,Yes,Never log or expose; use secure storage. No external AI API keys required.
AI/LLM Processing,Backend → Ollama (Local),sensor data for anomaly analysis; prompts; responses,No,No,100% local processing via Ollama llama3.2:1b on localhost:11434; no cloud transmission; fully isolated.
Ollama Service,Local System (localhost:11434),LLM model weights; inference requests; analysis results,No,No,Runs locally; no external network access; data never leaves device; GDPR compliant.

Legend:
* Sensitive? = Could this data identify a user or device, or be misused if leaked?
* Privacy Needed? = Should this data be protected (anonymized, encrypted, access-controlled)?
* "Yes*" = Sensitive if linked to a user or device.
