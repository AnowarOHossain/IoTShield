\noindent The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes has introduced critical vulnerabilities regarding data privacy and security. Conventional cloud-centric architectures often expose sensitive user data to third-party risks, necessitating a shift toward secure, edge-based solutions. This research presents ``IoTShield'', a comprehensive privacy-preserving home automation framework that integrates the lightweight MQTT protocol with Generative AI for intelligent anomaly detection. The system utilizes a hybrid edge-computing architecture featuring ESP32 microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi gateways to process data locally. To ensure robust privacy, a dual-layer Differential Privacy mechanism using Gaussian noise is applied, complemented by end-to-end RSA-2048 encryption for secure transmission. For anomaly detection, the system integrates a local Large Language Model (Llama 3.2:1B) to analyze sensor patterns and generate context-aware alerts with explainable insights. Experimental results from over 13,000 sensor readings demonstrate that the system achieves an end-to-end latency of under 2 seconds and successfully classifies anomalies across four severity levels (Low to Critical). This study confirms that combining local GenAI with cryptographic privacy mechanisms preserves data sovereignty while delivering a highly responsive and secure smart home environment.
