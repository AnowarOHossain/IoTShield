##  AI Integration Details

###  Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)

**Training:**
- 10,000 synthetic sensor readings
- Features: sensor value, historical mean, std, max, min, deviation
- Contamination rate: 10%
- 100 decision trees

**Detection Process:**
1. Extract features from current reading
2. Compare with 100 recent readings (1-hour window)
3. Calculate statistical features
4. Predict anomaly score (0-1 range)
5. Flag if score > threshold (0.5)

**Performance:**
- Real-time detection: < 100ms
- Accuracy: Validated with live data
- False positive rate: Optimized

###  Generative AI (Google Gemini 1.5 Flash)

**Configuration:**
```python
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
temperature = 0.7
max_output_tokens = 150
```

**Input Context:**
```json
{
  "sensor_type": "TEMPERATURE",
  "current_value": 45.3,
  "normal_range": "20-30°C",
  "location": "Living Room",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T16:45:12+00:00",
  "anomaly_score": 0.89
}
```

**Output Example:**
```json
{
  "title": "Critical Temperature Alert",
  "description": "Abnormally high temperature detected at 45.3°C",
  "suggestion": "Check for fire hazards or HVAC malfunction",
  "severity": "CRITICAL"
}
```

---

##  Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms

IoTShield implements multiple privacy layers:

### 1. **Differential Privacy Noise**
```python
# Gaussian noise added to sensor readings
noise = np.random.normal(0, epsilon * sensitivity)
private_value = original_value + noise
```

### 2. **Edge Processing**
- Data processed locally on Raspberry Pi before cloud transmission
- Sensitive raw data never leaves local network
- Only aggregated statistics transmitted

### 3. **Secure Communication**
- MQTT with TLS/SSL support (configurable)
- Encrypted database storage
- Token-based API authentication

### 4. **Data Minimization**
- Only essential sensor data collected
- Configurable data retention policies
- Automatic old data purging
