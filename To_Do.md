## üî¥ Critical Tasks (Required for Full Functionality)

### 1. ü¶ü MQTT Broker Setup (BLOCKING ALL IOT FEATURES)
- [ ] Install Mosquitto MQTT Broker
  - Windows: Download from https://mosquitto.org/download/
  - Linux/Mac: `sudo apt install mosquitto` or `brew install mosquitto`
- [ ] Start Mosquitto service
  - Windows: Run as service or `mosquitto -v`
  - Linux: `sudo systemctl start mosquitto`
- [ ] Configure MQTT credentials in `.env` (if using authentication)
- [ ] Test connection with MQTT client
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT DONE

### 2. ü§ñ ML Model Improvement (ACCURACY ISSUE)
- [ ] Fix feature extraction in model training
  - Current Issue: Model flagging ALL data as anomalies (10.55% accuracy)
  - Root Cause: Training script uses raw features, but anomaly_detector.py uses 6 statistical features
  - Fix Required: Match feature extraction in `train_model.py` to `anomaly_detector.py`
- [ ] Retrain model with proper features:
  1. Current value
  2. Mean of recent values
  3. Standard deviation
  4. Maximum value
  5. Minimum value
  6. Deviation from mean
- [ ] Test model with `evaluate_model.py`
